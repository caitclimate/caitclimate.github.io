I am a PhD student in the Department of Atmospheric Sciences at the University of Miami's Rosenstiel School of Marine, Atmospheric, and Earth Science. My research explores how atmospheric noise competes with ocean dynamics to shape the evolution and predictability of the El Ni√±o-Southern Oscillation (ENSO). My interests include high-resolution modeling, large-scale climate variability and predictability, air-sea interactions, and applying machine learning to weather and climate problems. I have an MS in Hydrologic Science and Engineering from the [Colorado School of Mines](https://www.mines.edu/) and a BA in Geology from the [University of Colorado Boulder](https://www.colorado.edu/). 

I enjoy developing sustainable research workflows, from building Python modules for data analysis to writing bash scripts for remote cluster computing to integrating knowledge management systems---technical practices that promote a healthy life-work balance, and I plan to share (more!) what I learn. I balance my time with backpacking, skiing, and paddle boarding with my husband and our GSD/husky mix, Kuma.
